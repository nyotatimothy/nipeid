# 🎉 Email Notification System - Implementation Complete!

## 📋 What We've Built

Your MyID app now has a **complete email notification system** that automatically sends professional emails to users when their lost documents are found! Here's what was implemented:

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. 📧 Professional Email Service
- **File**: `src/lib/emailService.ts`
- Configurable SMTP settings for Gmail, Outlook, or custom servers
- Beautiful HTML email templates with MyID branding
- Fallback text versions for all emails
- Error handling and email verification

### 2. 🔍 Smart Document Matching
- **File**: `src/lib/documentNotificationService.ts`
- Matches documents by exact document number, full name, or search terms
- Prevents duplicate notifications
- Batch processing for checking all requests
- Detailed logging for debugging

### 3. 💾 Enhanced Database Schema
- **New ContactRequest model** to store notification requests
- **New DOCUMENT_FOUND notification type**
- Migration applied: `20250527115423_add_document_found_notifications`

### 4. 🚀 API Endpoints
- `POST /api/contact-request` - Save notification requests
- `POST /api/test-email` - Send test emails
- `POST /api/admin/check-notifications` - Manual batch checking (admin only)

### 5. 🖥️ Frontend Integration
- **Homepage form** now saves real contact requests
- **Test page** at `/test-notifications` for email testing
- **Automatic integration** with document upload workflow

### 6. ⚡ Automatic Triggers
- **Document uploads automatically check for matches**
- **Real-time notifications** sent when matches are found
- **Zero manual intervention** required

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **User visits homepage and searches for document**
2. **If not found, user fills out contact request form**
3. **System saves request with search terms and contact info**
4. **When poster uploads matching document:**
   - System automatically runs notification check
   - Finds matching contact requests
   - Sends professional email with document details
   - Marks request as notified to prevent duplicates

## 📧 Email Template Features

The notification emails include:
- **Professional MyID Kenya branding**
- **Document details** (name, number, location found)
- **Collection kiosk information** (name, location, phone)
- **Required documents** for collection
- **Important deadlines** (30-day collection period)
- **Call-to-action links**
- **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop

## 🧪 Testing the System

### Quick Test:
1. Visit: `http://localhost:3000/test-notifications`
2. Enter your email and name
3. Click "Send Test Email"
4. Check your inbox!

### Full Workflow Test:
1. **Create contact request**: Search for non-existent document on homepage
2. **Upload matching document**: Login as poster and upload document with same details
3. **Check email**: Automatic notification should arrive!

## ⚙️ Setup Required

Create `.env.local` file with:
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com

For Gmail, you'll need an **App Password** (not your regular password).
