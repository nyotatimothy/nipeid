3. Click the **Edit** button.
4. Delete the following text: *Delete this line to make a change to the README from Bitbucket.*

## Create a file

Next, you’ll add a new file to this repository.

1. Click the **New file** button at the top of the **Source** page.
2. Give the file a filename of **contributors.txt**.
3. Enter your name in the empty file space.
4. Click **Commit** and then **Commit** again in the dialog.
5. Go back to the **Source** page.

Before you move on, go ahead and explore the repository. You've already seen the **Source** page, but check out the **Commits**, **Branches**, and **Settings** pages.

## Clone a repository

Use these steps to clone from SourceTree, our client for using the repository command-line free. Cloning allows you to work on your files locally. If you don't yet have SourceTree, [download and install first](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). If you prefer to clone from the command line, see [Clone a repository](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/4whODQ).

1. You’ll see the clone button under the **Source** heading. Click that button.
2. Now click **Check out in SourceTree**. You may need to create a SourceTree account or log in.
3. When you see the **Clone New** dialog in SourceTree, update the destination path and name if you’d like to and then click **Clone**.
4. Open the directory you just created to see your repository’s files.

Now that you're more familiar with your Bitbucket repository, go ahead and add a new file locally. You can [push your change back to Bitbucket with SourceTree](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/iqyBMg), or you can [add, commit,](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8QhODQ) and [push from the command line](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/NQ0zDQ).

# Nipe ID: Lost & Found Identity Document App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
2. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```
3. **Open the app:**
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## User Roles & Dashboards

- **Visitor:** Can search for documents, but must log in to claim.
- **User:** Can claim documents, view claimed docs, and report disputes.
- **Poster:** Can upload found documents and manage their uploads.
- **Kiosk Manager:** Manages kiosk inventory and document handover.
- **Admin:** Approves posters/kiosks, manages users, and views analytics.

## Testing Role-Based Protection

- Try to access `/admin`, `/poster`, `/kiosk`, `/user` as different roles or as a visitor.
- Unauthorized access will redirect to login or the correct dashboard.

## Accessibility & Mobile

- All forms and buttons are keyboard accessible.
- ARIA labels and semantic HTML are used for screen readers.
- Layouts are responsive for mobile and desktop.

## Troubleshooting
- If you see errors about `nodemailer` or `tls`, ensure you are not using email sign-in, or set the API route runtime to `nodejs`.
